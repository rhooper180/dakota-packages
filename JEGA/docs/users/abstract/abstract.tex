{\Large \bf Abstract}
\end{center}

JEGA is a software package that implements a multi-objective genetic
algorithm (MOGA) for solution to multi-objective optimization
problems (MOPs) and a single objective genetic algorithm (SOGA) for
solution to single objective optimization problems (SOPs). JEGA is
highly configurable and provides a rich set of algorithmic
components for tailored optimization.  It has been used successfully
on many problems by users both internal and external to Sandia.  By
employing object-oriented design to implement abstractions of the
key components making up the algorithms, JEGA provides a flexible
and extensible problem-solving environment for design and
performance analysis of computational models.

This report serves as a user's manual for the JEGA software and
provides capability overviews and procedures for software execution,
as well as a variety of example studies.
