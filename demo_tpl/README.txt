
This is a simple Demo which serves as a working example for bringing a new 
Third-Party-Library (TPL) into Dakota.  The Demo will serve to show minimal
requirements for:

 - building the Demo library under Dakota via Cmake
 - exposing Demo functionality, eg initialzation and execution, to Dakota
 - exposing Demo options to Dakota
 - transferring data, variables and responses, between Demo and Dakota

This is a work in progress.
