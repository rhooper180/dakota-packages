Overview:  

The LHS UNIX Library/Standalone software provides the capability to 
draw random samples from over 30 distribution types.  It performs the 
sampling by a stratified sampling method called Latin Hypercube 
Sampling (LHS).  Multiple distributions can be sampled simultaneously, 
with user-specified correlations amongst the input distributions. 
LHS UNIX Library/Standalone provides a way to generate multivariate 
samples.  The LHS samples can be generated either within the 
DAKOTA software framework or as a standalone capability.

FAQ:

1) Why is a full download of DAKOTA necessary if all I want to do is
   run LHS in standalone mode?

DAKOTA presently uses Cygnus configure for platform configuration.  In
order to preserve the user capability to build and install LHS on a
variety of platforms, it is necessary to use the fragments in the
config/ directory in DAKOTA for creating the Makefile used for
building LHS.  With that constraint, it isn't feasible to create a LHS
package for download with it's own config/ directory without a massive
rewrite.  All of DAKOTA need not be compiled however (see steps 4 and
5 in INSTALL).

NOTE: By the end of Summer 2004, a migration from using Cygnus
configure to the GNU Autotools is planned, which should make the
process of configuring and building individual components of DAKOTA
simpler.
