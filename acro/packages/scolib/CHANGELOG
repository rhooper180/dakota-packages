-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOLIB 2.3.2 (2013/11/11)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Minor improvements to the TGPO solver
  - Improved performance (separated TGP regression from EGO evaluation)
  - Improved user output
  - Additional error checks and squashed some bugs

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOLIB 2.3.1 (2013/04/29)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Minor improvements to the TGPO solver
  - Improved R interface
  - Improving some default parameters
  - Catching some edge conditions associated with unevaluated initial points

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOLIB 2.3 (2013/01/28)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Adding two new SCOLIB solvers:
  - TGPO: a Treed Gaussian Process guided Optimizer
  - StateMachinePS: A "pattern search" that uses stencil moves defined
    by a state machine

- Numerous fixes to the CMake build harness

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOLIB 2.2 (2011/11/22)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Fixes for the EA when the final point set contains duplicate points,
  and for reading the initial population from the inter-solver cache.

- Prototype CMake build harness

- Deprecating much of the use of cp_u within the build harness.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOLIB 2.1 (2010/12/21)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Improved static registration system.

- Tracking move of COLIN to use utilib Properties for configuring
  objects.

- Re-enabled the dynamic constraint penalty within the SolisWets
  optimizer.

- Reconstituting the EAminlp solver.

- Return additional points from solvers:
    * EA: return best point and final population
    * Direct: return best point and final "Pareto" set 

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
SCOLIB 2.0 (2008/12/14)
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Renamed Coliny to SCOLIB!   This reflects the fact that Coliny is an ensemble
  of COLIN optimizers, not all of which lie within the SCOLIB library.

- This is a major rework that uses the COLIN 3.0 solver interface.  Not all
  solvers are working properly (e.g. hybrids), but the basic functionality
  of these solvers has been reworked.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coliny 1.2
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- Misc fixes for portability in the coliny solver.

- Added a 'random' multi-objective optimizer: RandomMOO.  This was mostly
  developed to exercise the MO capabilities in COLIN, but it can provide
  a baseline for comparison for other MO solvers.  The output of this 
  solver has not been finalized.

- Fixed convergence issues in ea-ps tests.  The 'value' used for in
  the EA was changed to reflect a penalized constraint ... which led to
  solutions that were more feasible.  This changed the required
  convergence tolerance.

- Added the ability to register solvers with a Factory object.  Solver
  registration led to a rework of the coliny solver and show_options
  example (which was significantly simplified).  With this factory,
  an end-user application no longer needs to include coliny.h, and
  all of the Coliny headers, to use Coliny.

- Registered several new hybrid EA solvers ... which have not been
  tested and validated.

- Setup a MSVC++ configuration.

- Added the MultiStatePS class, which is still under development.

- Added valgrind tests.

- Integrated an NSGA2 code.  This code works, but the output for this
  solver has not been finalized.

- Added seeding to Coliny tests.

- Revised experimental tests to conform to the new style supported by 
  EXACT.  Reworked the coliny test script to support independent 
  parameterization of hybrid solvers.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coliny 1.1
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

- exposed method 'OptProblem::reset_neval_request_id()' to enable
  DAKOTA to specify the asynchronous request IDs used within COLIN solvers.


-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Coliny 1.0
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Initial release.
