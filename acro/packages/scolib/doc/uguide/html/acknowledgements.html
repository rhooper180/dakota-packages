The genesis of the SGOPT library is the BBUMS library developed by Bill Hart and Brian Bartell while graduate students at U.C. San Diego. Many of the optimizers in SGOPT were initially developed in BBUMS. The BBUMS library was subsequently reorganized and divided into SGOPT and UTILIB; UTILIB provides generic C++ templates and support for portability.<p>
