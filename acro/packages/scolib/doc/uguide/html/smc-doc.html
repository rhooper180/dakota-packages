Stratified Monte Carlo</a></h2>

Overview</a></h3>
The class sMC provides an abstract base class for stratified Monte Carlo sampling (sMC). Stratified Monte Carlo sampling partitions the search domain into a finite number of disjoint regions, each of which is sampled independently. In each iteration sMC samples a point from each region (from a fixed distribution), and the best of these points is reported. sMC reduces to standard Monte Carlo sampling algorithm (MC) in the case where there is a single region, the entire search domain. Ermakov, Zhigyavskii and Kondratovich [ErmZhiKon89a] and Hart [Har94] provide formal descriptions and theoretical analyses of sMC. It is particularly interesting to note that for a given number of samples from the total search domain, the probability that sMC samples an epsilon-close point is greater than or equal to the probability that MC samples an epsilon-close point.<p>
Classes sMCreal and sMCint provide a common interface for performing sMC on <img class="formulaInl" alt="$R^n$" src="form_9.png"> and <img class="formulaInl" alt="$Z^n$" src="form_10.png">. The method <code>set_lsopt</code> in these classes defines a local search optimizer and specifies the frequency with which local search should be applied to the randomly generated points. When <code>freq</code> = 1.0, this converts sMCreal to stratified multistart local search (see Morris and<p>
Wong [WonMor89,MorWon91] and Hart [Har94]).<h3><a class="anchor" name="smcstatus">
Current Status</a></h3>
sMC and sMCreal are stable. sMCint needs to be re-implemented. The termination rules described in Hart [Har94] need to be incorporated into sMC. </BODY>
