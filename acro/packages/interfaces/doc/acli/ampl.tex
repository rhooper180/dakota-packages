\section{Optimizing Within AMPL}

AMPL examples

Overview of usage model: (1) define problem, (2) specify solver, (3) call 'solve', (4) analyze final solution and related info (e.g. lagrange multipliers)

Features of ACLI: (1) multi-point response, (2) solver is 'acro', but 'acro' contains all optimizers built with Acro, (3) pre-specified hybrid solvers (hooks for initializing them separately)
