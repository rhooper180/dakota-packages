This directory houses simple regression solutions for the baseline TGA
validation cycle. A time record of the resulting Matlab style solutions
are maintained here along with this log which documents changes to the
reference solution.

Notes:

-> May 2009: initial reference solution checked in for use with
   automatic regression testing. 
-> July 2010: new reference solution checked in (basically, it is printed
   out to the output file with more precision)
-> September 2014: new samples are drawn as a result of a change in transition
   kernel, so the reference solution is being updated
