<b>Quantification of Uncertainty for Estimation, Simulation and Optimization (QUESO) </b>

The QUESO library is a collection of C++ classes and algorithms to
support model validation and the prediction of quantities of interest
with uncertainty quantification (UQ) included.  QUESO is designed for
flexibility, portability, and extensibility and adopts an
object-oriented software design.  QUESO supports distributed-memory
parallelism using MPI and can run within uniprocessor or
multiprocessor environments.

The QUESO library contains two forms of documentation: a User's Manual
available in pdf format and this lower-level code documentation in web
based/html format.

\section bugs Reporting Bugs

Bugs in the code and errors or omissions in the documentation can be reported
to queso-users@googlegroups.com or as a

Requests and contributions are also welcome using either of the two methods
mentioned above.

All bug reports should include:
<ul>
<li>the version number of the QUESO library,
<li>the hardware and operating system,
<li>the compiler used, including version number and compilation options,
<li>a description of the bug behavior, and ideally, 
<li>a short program which reproduces the bug.
</ul>
