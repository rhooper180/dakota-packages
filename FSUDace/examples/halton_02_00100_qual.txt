  Compiled on Oct  7 2004 at 06:19:43.

  Measures of uniform point dispersion.

  The pointset was read from "halton_02_00100.txt".

  The spatial dimension NDIM =     2
  The number of points N =         100
  The number of sample points NS = 100000
  The random number SEED_INIT =    123456789

  The regularity measure         Chi = 5.1746
  2nd moment determinant measure   D = 6.62849e-07
  The point distribution norm      H = 0.124875
  2nd moment trace measure       Tau = 0.00165464
