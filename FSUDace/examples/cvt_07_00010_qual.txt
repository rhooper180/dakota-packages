  Compiled on Oct  7 2004 at 06:19:43.

  Measures of uniform point dispersion.

  The pointset was read from "cvt_07_00010.txt".

  The spatial dimension NDIM =     7
  The number of points N =         10
  The number of sample points NS = 100000
  The random number SEED_INIT =    123456789

  The regularity measure         Chi = 3.26241
  2nd moment determinant measure   D = 1.48555e-14
  The point distribution norm      H = 1.0822
  2nd moment trace measure       Tau = 0.0148465
