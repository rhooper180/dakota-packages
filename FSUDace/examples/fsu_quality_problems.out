FSU_QUALITY_PROBLEMS
  Test the C++ FSU_QUALITY library.

FSU_QUALITY_PROBLEMS:
  Measures of uniform point dispersion.

  The pointset was read from "halton_02_00100.txt"

  The spatial dimension NDIM =     2
  The number of points N =         100
  The number of sample points NS = 100000
  The random number SEED_INIT =    123456789


  5x5 portion of data read from file:
